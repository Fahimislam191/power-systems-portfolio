# Power Systems Portfolio

## About Me
I am a recent graduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from North South University, Bangladesh. My studies focused on power systems, VLSI, and robotics. I have skills in MATLAB/Simulink, AutoCAD, Python, and C programming. I aim to work in renewables and power design.

## Internship Summary
During my internship at North South University substation, I supervised operations, monitored voltage and current, and prepared a report on generation, control, and distribution. I learned about gas generators, transformers, switchgear, and safety protocols. This experience helped me connect theory to real work.
